# Udacity-memory-game
The memory card game where you have to match 8 sets of cards.
Game Rules
The game board contains sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The rules to the game are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

With each turn:
-The player flips one card over to reveal its hidden symbol.
-The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
-If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over and get highlighted green.
-If the cards do not match, both cards get highlighted red before being flipped face down.
-The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
